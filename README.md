## 🚨 The Problem
In India, farmers face a dual tragedy:
1.  **Crop Loss:** Diseases like Blight or Rust destroy seasons.
2.  **Financial Loss:** Despite government insurance schemes (like *PMFBY*), **70% of claims are rejected** due to complex paperwork, lack of evidence, and inability to prove localized calamity.

## 💡 The Solution
Kisan-Vibe uses **Multimodal AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash / 3 Pro)** to bridge the gap.
* **For the Farmer:** It diagnoses the disease from a photo AND instantly matches it to the specific government insurance clause that covers that loss.
* **For the Government:** It provides a fraud-proof, geo-tagged "Proof of Loss" and a real-time heatmap of disease outbreaks.
